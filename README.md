# What is 42?

> 42 is a future-proof computer science training to educate the next generation of software engineers.
The 42 program takes a project-based approach to progress and is designed to develop technical and 
people skills that match the expectations of the labor market.

This is the common core. 16 projects focused on convering the fundamentals of Computer Science. After Transcedence (The final boss) you can start the specialization projects.

(Projects under the same number are candidates for that level, students must pick only one.)
